# ClimaCell Python Homework

## Approach

In order to resample (regrid) the input wind data, I have made use of the [pyresample](https://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package, which was specifically designed "for resampling geospatial image data" for use with the [SatPy](https://github.com/pytroll/satpy) library, a python library used for "manipulating meterological remote sensing data". Since [pyresample](https://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) makes use of the [PROJ](https://proj.org/) project, common cartographic projections used by meterological applications are available for use for resampling purposes.

For this simple assignment, I have selected the [UTM](https://proj.org/operations/projections/utm.html) projection, zone 13 (covering, e.g., Boulder), ellipsoid [WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) as the default projection with its natural origin, i.e., neglecting the application of the nominal UTM false easting and northing. Although the [Transverse Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_Mercator_projection) projections (such as [UTM](https://proj.org/operations/projections/utm.html)) are not area preserving (like the [Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area](https://proj.org/operations/projections/laea.html) projection), they are angle preserving, i.e., they are conformal mappings, and, therefore, are good for applications that employ small scale maps, particularly local weather analyses such as used with the data sets supplied here. If an alternate projection is preferred for grid resampling, it may be specified by means of the `-p/--projection` command line option, which expects a PROJ4 projection string format. The specified projection must be compatible with units based on meters rather than degrees, as the current code normalizes all area coordinates to meters. The specified (or default) projection applies to both source and target areas.

## Additional Notes

1. Both source and target areas, specified with the `-s/--sArea` and `-t/--tArea` command line options, are interpreted in meters or degrees depending on the value of the `-u/--units` option (default is `m`). If not specified, the source area defaults to 500 meters width (longitude) and height (latitude). If the target shape is not specified, it defaults to the source shape. For the purpose of resampling, the centers of the areas are their centroids (and not their top, left corners). In order to allow specifying a target area which center is not coincident with the source area's center, a `-o/--tOffset` option is available which takes a longitude/latitude offset (in meters or degrees according to the applicable units) with respect to the center of the source area. If no offset is specified, and the target shape is not the same as the source shape, then an offset is implied that places the target area such that its upper left corner coincides with the upper left corner of the source area; however, if the target area is not specified (but defaulted to the source area), then its offset will default to `[0,0]` which places it coincident to the center of the source area.

2. Although [pyresample](https://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a number of resampling algorithms, I have selected a simple and quick approximate nearest neighbor algorithm for this exercise. Other algorithms are available, including bilinear, elliptical weighted average (EWA), and Gaussian weighted, but are not yet exposed by this tool.

3. In addition to first order resampling (mapping from source to target areas), the present implementation can also optionally perform a second order downsampling of the output image data by scaling the output image with a specified scaling factor as specified by the `-r/--rescale` option, which takes a ratio (less than or equal to 1.0).

4. The [pyresample](https://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) implementation supports multiprocessor platforms. For this exercise, the maximum number of processors available are used for resampling operations, however, a command line option `--nprocs` is available to permit user control over the actual cpu count.

5. For the purpose of converting between degrees to linear distance, the instructions specify use of a fixed conversion factor of 500 meters per 0.005 degrees latitude (and longitude), which works out to 100km/degree. I will just mention that the relationship between degrees latitude and longitude and linear distance is not constant on the surface of the Earth; for latitude, it is nearly constant at ~111km/degree, slightly increasing towards the poles; however, for longitude, it is at a maximum (also ~111km) near the equator, and decreasing to zero at the poles. As a consequence, using a constant mapping of 100km/degree, while a convenient simplification, introduces gross errors when used to process real world data. However, since we are using the [UTM](https://proj.org/operations/projections/utm.html) projection for resampling (by default), which has its origin on the Equator, then the mapping turns out to be nearly constant, so the stated conversion is not unreasonable as a rough approximation.

8. Get version information.

```
% python -m climahw.homework --version
climahw 1.0.1 03/11/2020
```

## Testing

After the `conda` environment is activated as described in [Installation](#installation),
testing may be performed by running the`test.sh` script from the top-level directory:

```
% bash test.sh
```

This will perform style, lint, and type checks, then re-run the examples described above, comparing the output images against the images previously computed and saved in the top-level `out` directory.

The nominal output from a successful test should read as follows:

```
python -m black --check climahw
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
5 files would be left unchanged.
python -m pylint climahw

## Potential Improvements

1. Improve usage message (add default option values, improve option argument labels, etc).

2. Test alternative projections.

3. Eliminate assumptions about degree to length conversions, in which case it will be necessary to add option for user to specify lat/lon origin of source area. At present, defaults to origin of UTM zone.

4. Add further inline code documentation and expand variable name length should this code evolve into production code.

5. Add support for additional resample methods (bilinear, kdtree, elliptical, Gaussian, etc)

6. Obtain performance benchmarking metrics by resampling method and cpu count.
